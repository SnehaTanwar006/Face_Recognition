# 🧠 Face Recognition System using OpenCV

This project provides a practical implementation of a face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and machine learning. You can train it using your own dataset (e.g., folders like `person1`, `person2`, etc.) and use it to recognize faces from webcam or images.

## 📌 Features

- **Detect and recognize faces in real-time**  
- **Train on your own custom dataset**  
- **Simple dataset structure and user-friendly scripts**  
- **Easily extendable with other ML models**

---

## 📂 Dataset Structure

Create a `dataset/` directory in your project root with subfolders for each individual. Each subfolder should contain face images of that person:


> **Tip**: Use clear, front-facing images with varying angles and lighting for better accuracy.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Ensure you have **Python 3.6+** installed. Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
```
